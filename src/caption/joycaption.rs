//! JoyCaption caption **product policy**.
//!
//! The JoyCaption model (SigLIP vision tower + LLaVA projector + image splice + Llama-3.1 decode +
//! the model's LLaVA chat-input format) lives in the unified LLM engine
//! ([`mlx-llm`](https://github.com/SceneWorks/mlx-llm)) as the `mlx-joycaption`
//! `core_llm::TextLlm` vision provider. This module keeps only the SceneWorks-side caption product
//! surface — the caption-type/length prompt templates, the advertised capability bounds, and the
//! trigger-word post-processing — that a consumer uses to build the prompt text before calling the
//! engine (epic 7153, sc-7265). It contains no model-specific code.
