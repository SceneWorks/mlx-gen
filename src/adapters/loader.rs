//! Adapter-file loaders — read a trained LoRA/LoKr `.safetensors` and install it onto a
//! model tree via [`AdaptableHost`]. Closes out sc-2343's loader piece.
//!
//! **LoKr** is generic and faithfully ported from the fork's `LoKrLoader.apply`: keys are
//! bare module paths (`‹path›.lokr_w1`/`lokr_w2`, full or low-rank `_a`/`_b`) and the file
//! carries `networkType=lokr` + `alpha`/`rank` in safetensors metadata, so the delta and
//! target path are fully determined by the file — no per-model mapping table.
//!
//! **LoRA** here covers two on-disk conventions, both family-agnostic:
//! - **PEFT/diffusers** (`‹prefix›‹path›.lora_A/B.weight` + optional `‹path›.alpha`): dotted module
//!   paths resolve directly via [`AdaptableHost::adaptable_mut`] ([`apply_lora_peft`]).
//! - **kohya / sd-scripts** (`lora_unet_‹path, .→_›.lora_down/up.weight` + optional `.alpha`,
//!   sc-2618): the flattened module path can't be re-split blindly, so it resolves through a
//!   `flattened → dotted` table built from [`AdaptableHost::adaptable_paths`]
//!   ([`apply_lora_kohya`]). kohya `lora_down`/`lora_up` == PEFT `lora_A`/`lora_B`, so both feed the
//!   shared [`install_lora_groups`] and a kohya file yields the identical adapter to its PEFT twin.
//!
//! - **BFL / ComfyUI** (`lora_unet_double_blocks_*` / `diffusion_model.…` / `base_model.model.…`,
//!   sc-2743): a *fused* source linear (`…img_attn.qkv`, `…linear1`) is row-sliced into the model's
//!   *split* targets (`attn.to_q/to_k/to_v`, …) via per-target [`LoraRowSlice`] transforms, with BFL
//!   module renames (`img_in`→`x_embedder`). This is fused→split weight surgery, orthogonal to the
//!   kohya underscore form; the host supplies its table via [`AdaptableHost::bfl_targets`]
//!   ([`apply_lora_bfl`]). Only FLUX.2/FLUX.1 expose one; for other hosts a BFL file's keys surface as
//!   unmatched (loud), never silently dropped.
